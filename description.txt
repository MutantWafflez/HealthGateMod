Adds a configurable Health Gating (also known as One Shot Protection or OSP) mechanic to Terraria.

Here's how it works:
Above or at a certain threshold of HP, damage to the player that would otherwise kill them (or come very close to it) sets their HP to a minimum pre-defined percentage of said HP.
If the player is not above or at the minimum protection threshold, Health Gating will not be active and no protection is granted.

All values can be configured, and there are more configuration options than shown here, but these two are the most important:
* Minimum Protection Threshold (default: 50%)
	-> This is, at minimum, what percentage of HP you must have in order to have Health Gate Protection.
* Minimum Remaining Percentage (default: 5%)
	-> What percentage of HP you will have after being Health Gated.
For a balanced experience, the default configuration values are recommended.

Note: Health Gating does not protect against player butchers/insta-kills forced by the game itself, vanilla or modded, for compatibility sake.

Note 2: Translations are not 100% accurate.
